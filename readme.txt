This was created as my final project for Web Client Side Programming during the Winter quarter of the 2012-2013 academic year at RIT. Its requirements involved creating a useful tool out of combining the use of the Google Maps API along with two other API's of my choosing.

I decided to use this project to create a tool to automatically detect the user's location and to display nearby and upcoming music and social events. I utilized the Google Maps, lastFM, and Eventful API's to create this project.

Almost all of the code was created by myself other than the PHP proxy script which was provided by professor Jeffrey Sonstein. I also used several small chunks of code that I borrowed from Google's examples and adapted for use in this project in order to utilize the Google Maps API.
