This project was created as my final project for Web Client Side Programming (4002-536-02) during the Winter quarter of the 2012-2013 academic year at RIT.
Almost all of the code was created by myself (Sam Wechter) other than the PHP proxy script which was provided by professor Jeffrey Sonstein and the Google Maps API.
