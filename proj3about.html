	 <h1>About Project 3</h1>
	 <p class="aboutP">Tools used: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps API v3</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.FM API</a>,
						  <a href="http://api.eventful.com/">Eventful API</a></p>
	 <p class="aboutP">This project was created by Samuel Wechter in February 2013 for Jeffrey Sonstein's Web Client Side Programming class at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Almost everything is working
	 correctly but due to time constraints the area that contains event search results has some spacing issues when displaying music events. Social event descriptions may occasionally
	 contain small amounts of garbage text due to the way Eventful formats its event descriptions. The project page and this about page are HTML5 and CSS3 validated and should not produce any JavaScript
	 console errors.</p>
